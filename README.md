# Hack Recursive Function Stack Overflow

This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive functions written in Hack: stack overflow. The `foo` function calculates the factorial of a number recursively. While this is a concise way to implement the factorial, it's prone to stack overflow errors for larger inputs.

The `bug.hack` file contains the buggy code, and `bugSolution.hack` shows the corrected iterative solution.  The README provides context on the issue and the solution.
